# My Dotfiles

This is running with Bash on a Mac

## This repository's structure

`dotfiles` directory holds all subsequent settings. This helps visibility.

The entry point is `~/dotfiles/init.sh`. It finds all nested directories and parses all `.sh` files under each of those directories. Only 'General' and 'Programs' are **not** gitignored, so add more directories to put your private things in.

> \* Files in the repo are **opt in**. Meaning everything is gitignored by default.

Each entry is measured to create visibility of startup cost.
